        <p>
          The Gothons of Planet Percal #77 have invaded your ship and destroyed
          your entire crew. You are the last surviving member and your last
          mission is to get the neutron destruct bomb from the weapons Armony,
          put it in bridge, and blow the ship up after getting into an escape
          pod
          <br />

          You are running down the central corridor to the weapons Armony when
          Gothon jumps out, red scaly skin, dark grimy teeth, and evil clown
          costume flowing around his hate filled body. He's blocking the door to
          the Armony and about to pull a weapon to blast your
          <br />

          You do a dive roll into the Weapon Armony, crouch and scan the room
          for more Gothons that might be hiding, It's dead quiet, too quiet. You
          stand up and run to the far side of the room and find the reutron bomb
          in its container.
          <br />
          There's a keypad lock on the box and you need the code to get the bomb
          out. If you get the code wrong 10 times then the lock closes forever
          and you can't get the bomb. The code is 3 digit input: use 3 input
          field and can increase number.

          You burst onto the bridge with the netron destruct bomb under your arm
          and surprise 5 Gothons who are trying to take control the ship. Each
          of them has an even uglier clown costume than the last. They haven't
          pulled their weapon out yet, as they see the active bomb under your
          arm and don't want to setit off

          You rush through the ship desperately trying to make it to the escape
          pod before the whole ship explodes. It seems like hardly any Gothons
          are on the ship, so your run is clear of interference. You get to the
          chamber with the escape pods, and now need to pick one to take. Some
          of them could be damaged but you don't have time to look. there are 5
          pods with specific color, which do you take (green, yellow, blue, red,
          black).
